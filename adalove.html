<div class="project-introduction">
    <h2>Road Safety Iowa</h2>
    <p>I designed a brand called "AdaLove" with the goal of encouraging young girls to learn coding. This platform is designed to be an interactive and educational space where girls can explore various aspects of programming, including web development and game design, all while focusing on creativity and problem-solving.</p>

<div class="process-section">
    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>The first step in this project was for me to deeply understand the target audienceâ€”young girls who are interested in learning to code. I conducted research to identify the challenges they face and what piques their interest. This research informed my approach, allowing me to craft content that was not only engaging but also approachable, fun, and empowering. My goal was to break down complex concepts into simple, relatable terms that would resonate with these young learners.
    </p>
    <h2>Ideation</h2>
    <p>With a clear understanding of my audience and goals, I began the ideation for this project. I wanted the site to be visually appealing, intuitive, and user-friendly, making it a place where girls would want to spend time learning. I used bright colors, playful typography, and clear navigation to create an inviting atmosphere. I also designed the UI to guide users smoothly through the learning process, incorporating interactive elements like drag-and-drop exercises, quizzes, and coding challenges to keep the experience engaging.</p>
    <h2>Initial Designs</h2>
    <p>These are my initial designs!</p>

<div class="final-section">
    <h2>Final</h2>
    <p>These are my final designs. I created educational materials that catered to different skill levels, from beginners to more advanced coders. I developed tutorials, coding exercises, and inspirational stories about women in tech. My focus was on making the content both informative and motivational, helping to build confidence and resilience in young learners. I wanted to ensure that the materials were accessible and easy to understand, knowing that this was crucial for the target audience.</a></p>
