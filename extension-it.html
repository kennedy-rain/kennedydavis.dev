    <h2>Extension IT</h2>
    <p>Road Safety Iowa is a federally funded program focused on providing early treatment to those with struggling with substace abuse.
        During this program, I designed a multiple deliverables including a logo, bi-fold brochure, business card, flyer, and a multi-page website.
        I proceeded to develop multiple pages of this website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>During this project, we spent a great amount of time looking at who our target audience was.
        We compiled research about who is most effected by substance abuse, specifically its relation to drivers who are found driving under the influence.
        We created user stories and personas of the type of people we would be designing for.
    </p>
    <h2>Ideation</h2>
    <p>Using this research, I began sketching ideas and looking at inspiration from rehab and therapy websites. As a recovery site, I wanted my designs to be have themes of growth, health, and inclusitivity.
        It was important to me to remain age-nuetral, gender-nuetral, and non-discriminatory.</p>
