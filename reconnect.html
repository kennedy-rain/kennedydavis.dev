    <h2>Reconnect</h2>
    <p>
        Reconnect is an app concept designed to tackle the growing issue of social media and screen addiction by offering a digital detox solution that encourages users to step away from their devices and reconnect with both nature and real-life relationships. With the increasing prevalence of screen time and social media use, many people find themselves overwhelmed, distracted, and socially disconnected despite being constantly online. Reconnect aims to break this cycle by reminding users of the importance of connections in their life, and encouraging them to reconnect to outside world by promoting local events, weather-based activities, and encouraging hangouts with friends.</p>

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
    <p>As technology become more popular and screen addiction
      becomes a bigger problem, many people are struggling to connect
      with their lives outside of technology.</p>
    <h3>User Interviews</h3>
    <p>In designing the Reconnect app, I conducted comprehensive user research to understand the behaviors, motivations, and pain points of individuals seeking digital detox and outdoor activities.
        I researched potential users such as college students who frequently find themselves staring at screens for long periods of time for classes, young people who struggle with addiction to social media, and people who work on their computer often. These interviews exposed what features people would benefit from an app centered around minimizing screen time.
    <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <p>Many users found that using screen time management systems were ineffective due to the lack of motivation it brougt to stay offline. Interviews also revealed that the motivation to stay offline were more efficient if there were external factors such as visiting friends or going to events.</p>
    </p>
    <h3>Content Audit</h3>
    <p><strong>High Priority</strong><br>• Suggestions for ourdoor/non-digital activities:<br>This is what is most likely to get people offline, and
      this is the core feature of the app.<br>
      • Ability to connect with friends and invite friends places:<br>It is much more motivational for people
      to spend time off their screens if it’s with others, and spending time with loved ones is a core part
      of the apps mission</p>
      <p><strong>Medium Priority</strong>
      <br>• Individual profiles and calendars:<br>In terms of the social aspect of this app, being able to view a
      person’s profile and see their full availability would be helpful, but it is not necessary to getting
      people to connect with their friends
      <br>• Calendar of events in town:<br>This would be very helpful for users to plan outings</p>
      <p><strong>Low Priority</strong><br>
        • Reviews of places/comments:<br>This would be a nice feature to have, but it could discourage people
  from trying new places out and isn’t crucial to the apps mission.
      </p>
    <h3>Site Map</h3>
    <p>After deciding what features would be best suited for user needs, I developed a Site Map of the flow of the app with the necessary screens and features.</p>

    <h2>Brand Identity</h2>
    <h3>Messaging</h3>
    <p>The messaging for this brand is motivating, focused, and encouraging.</p>
    <h3>Logo</h3>
    <p>The gradient from blue to green suggests a transition from digital (blue, often associated with tech) to natural (green, symbolizing nature and growth). This visually reinforces the idea of moving away from screens and toward real-world connections. The three connected circles can represent friends, family, and nature, emphasizing balance and real-life relationships. The clean, modern typography in "reconnect" feels friendly and inviting, while the rounded letters match the circular theme of the logo.</p>

    </div>
    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <p>This color scheme has a bright, nature-
      inspired palette that would be a great choice
      for the Reconnect app concept. Since the app
      is about digital detox and encouraging users
      to reconnect with people and nature, these
      colors—greens, blues, and teal—convey a
      sense of freshness, tranquility, and connection
      to the natural world.</p>

    <p>
      <br>
      <strong>Green:</strong> The bright green used represents
      growth, energy, and calmness. This ties in
      well with Reconnect’s aim to promote health
      and mindfulness by spending time outdoors.
      Green is also known to reduce stress and
      increase a sense of harmony, making it perfect
      for an app focused on well-being.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Teal and Aqua:</strong> These colors add a refreshing,
      cool contrast to the greens, creating a balance
      that can feel soothing and rejuvenating.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Dark Mode:</strong> The app being in dark mode adds
      to this feeling of being ‘offline’ and reduces
      the strain on eyes. Blue light has been known
      to strain sight and disrupt sleep rythyms, so
      reducing the blue light expsosure on the app
      aligns with the mission and values.</p>
